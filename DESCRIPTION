Title: Seasonal Trend Decomposition Using Regression
Version: 0.7.1.9000
Description: Methods for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend 
  time series decomposition procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In 
  some ways, STR is similar to Ridge Regression and Robust STR can be related to 
  LASSO. They allow for multiple seasonal components, multiple linear covariates 
  with constant, flexible and seasonal influence. Seasonal patterns (for both 
  seasonal components and seasonal covariates) can be fractional and flexible 
  over time; moreover they can be either strictly periodic or have a more 
  complex topology. The methods provide confidence intervals for the estimated 
  components. The methods can also be used for forecasting.
