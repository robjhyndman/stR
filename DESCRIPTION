Package: stR
Title: STR Decomposition
Version: 0.7
Description: Methods for decomposing seasonal data: STR (a Seasonal-Trend 
  decomposition procedure based on Regression) and Robust STR. In some ways, 
  STR is similar to Ridge Regression and Robust STR can be related to LASSO. 
  They allow for multiple seasonal components, multiple linear covariates with 
  constant, flexible and seasonal influence. Seasonal patterns (for both seasonal 
  components and seasonal covariates) can be fractional and flexible over time; 
  moreover they can be either strictly periodic or have a more complex topology. 
  The methods provide confidence intervals for the estimated components. The 
  methods can also be used for forecasting.
